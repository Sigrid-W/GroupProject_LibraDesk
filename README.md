# Project Overview

The Library Management System is designed to efficiently manage the inventory of a library, including book inventory, readers, and rental transactions. All information is stored in a database, allowing the system to read current records and write updated information back to maintain accurate and up-to-date data. 

# Functionality

The system allows library staff to manage readers effectively. New readers can be added to the system, existing member information can be updated, and members can be removed when needed.

In addition to managing readers, the system also handles book inventory. New books can be added to the collection, and existing books can have their information updated, including adjusting the number of available copies. Books that are no longer part of the libraryâ€™s collection can also be removed from the inventory. This ensures that the library maintains an accurate record of all available books.

Rental records are fully supported by the system. When a member borrows a book, a new rental entry is created with all relevant details, such as the member ID, librarian ID, book ID, and due date. The system can update rental information as needed and accurately record the return of books, automatically updating the inventory and availability. This makes it easy to track which books are currently borrowed and ensures that overdue books can be managed effectively.

# Problem Solved

It reduces errors and inconsistencies by automating the management of members, books, and rental transactions. By providing a single source of truth for all library data, the system allows staff to maintain an organized and efficient workflow. Librarians no longer need to manually track book availability, member information, or rental records, which saves time and reduces the risk of mistakes.
